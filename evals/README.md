## Evaluations

- **Purpose**: Capture evidence (benchmarks, experiments, usability studies) that informs decisions.
- **How to use**:
  - Create a new evaluation from `docs/templates/eval.md`.
  - Link to the related plan and ADR in the frontmatter.
  - Keep Results concise; store raw data under `artifacts/` or link to external sources.

### Where to add evals
- Root-level `evals/` for cross-cutting topics.
- App-level `app-web/evals/`, `app-srv/main/evals/` for app-scoped topics.
